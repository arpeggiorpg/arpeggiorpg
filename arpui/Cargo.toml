# arpeggio depend on rand, which depends on getrandom, which by default does not work on WASM. We
# need to enable the "js" feature. Unfortunately, since arpui is not a workspace member, we have to
# manually pin the version to the same one. (Wait, why aren't we a workspace member again? mostly
# because I'm afraid of dependency conflicts between workers-rs and dioxus versions of dependencies)
